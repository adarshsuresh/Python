Part III. You are welcome to reuse code you wrote for assignment 1,
but we would like to know how you handled the following tasks.

5. How did you calculate precision, recall and F1 score? If you used a
separate script, please give the name of the script and describe how
to run it.

ANS: I used a seperate script called per_performace.py.
    python3 per_performance.py path/to/train/data path/to/dev/data
    

6. How did you separate 10% of the training data? If you used a
separate script, please give the name of the script and describe how
to run it. Explain how you or your code choose the files.

ANS: I used a script called DataGenerator10.py.To run the 10% data generator
 python3 DataGenerator10.py path/to/exsisting/root path/to/the/new/root.
 The script takes each folder and selects 10% of data at random, copies the
 files to the  new root and also recreates the similar directory structure.
